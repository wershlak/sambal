# Sambal

Sambal is a ruby samba client

Quite a bit of code was borrowed from https://github.com/reivilo/rsmbclient - Thanks!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sambal'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sambal

## Requirements

A working installation of samba, specifically the "smbclient" command line utility. See http://www.samba.org for more information.
On a mac this can be installed through homebrew https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew, like this:
    
    brew install samba

On the Mac it can probably also be installed both through Fink and MacPorts.

On Linux (Ubuntu) it's as easy as:
    
    apt-get install smbclient

It should be available in a similar way on all major Linux distributions.

## Usage

    client = Sambal::Client.new(domain: 'WORKGROUP', host: '127.0.0.1', share: '', user: 'guest', password: '--no-pass', port: 445)

options:

    domain: 'WORKGROUP'
    host: '127.0.0.1'
    share: ''
    user: 'guest'
    password: '--no-pass'
    port: ''
    max_protocol: ''
    config_file: ''
use:

    client.ls # returns hash of files
    client.put("local_file.txt","remote_file.txt") # uploads file to server
    client.put_content("My content here", "remote_file") # uploads content to a file on server
    client.get("remote_file.txt", "local_file.txt") # downloads file from server
    client.delete("remote_file.txt") # deletes files from server
    client.cd("some_directory") # changes directory on server
    client.close # closes connection
    client.exists?("some_file") #returns true or false
